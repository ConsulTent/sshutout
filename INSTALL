The sshutout daemon is fairly simple to install provided you have a GCC toolchain
that is suitable for building binaries for your target system. To build the
binary, run the following commands:

	$ su -
	# tar -xzvf sshutout-1.0.6.tar.gz
	# cd sshutout-1.0.6
	# make
	# make install

The installation process will place three new files onto your system. These are:

	/usr/local/sbin/sshutout
	/usr/man/man8/sshutout.8
	/etc/sshutout.conf

The first file is the executable binary for the daemon. The second file is a man
page, and the third file is a sample configuration file. These three files may be
copied to other systems as needed to effect additional installations assuming
the processor architecture and object libraries are compatible.

To complete the installation, you will need to edit your system startup scripts and add
a line or two to invoke the sshutout daemon. For example, insert the following lines
just after the invocation of sshd:

	if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/sshutout ]; then
	   rm -f /var/run/sshutout.pid
	   /usr/local/sbin/sshutout
	fi

You should also customize the configuration file:

	/etc/sshutout.conf

to reflect your target system's particular needs. It is especially important to make sure that the
"sshd_log_file" parameter is set to the proper path. After customization, you may either
invoke sshutout directly (as root), or you may reboot your system.
